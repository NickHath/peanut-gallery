* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score
from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.

The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.

This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic
landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so
effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the
American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge
of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the
location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales
of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who
Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source
material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From
Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled
at this production when it was released at the box-office was in
lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in
comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter
not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his
earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV
set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the
video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian
counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version.
Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its
gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag
movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter
by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the
slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the
shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid
the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably
tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special
effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative
licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his
teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to
Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with
his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still
retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award
nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did
earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away
from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for
Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this
production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could
be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack
of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the
tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt
Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light
comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a
psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter
himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie
together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching
its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also
supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was
so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the
plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this
shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens
the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout
the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien
interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the
breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to
its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in
capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith
David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt
Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to
take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two
characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of
their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on
human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another
perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver
an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines
of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what
happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar
for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office
marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio,
big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both
were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter'
to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences
warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster,
'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it
deserves.

A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is
suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian
research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs
from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US
team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or
missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians
burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien
life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over
and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread
like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by
The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John
Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and
ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could
be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative
and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and
will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't
generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too
much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at
least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I
think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the
lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.

John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo
Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great
movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a
first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of
Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest
masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the
title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such
a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after
Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its
theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything
to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over
the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed
by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell
short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in
Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any
creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its
discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of
the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a
remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World,
which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who
Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable.
Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside
of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on
earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can
live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by
Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from
outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its
reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously
speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never
explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors
and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like
i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.

No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John
Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived
on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the
80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back
then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient
antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a
veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters
and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen
to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic
researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft
buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that
upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an
imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh
and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust,
mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For
me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's
ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians
in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of
the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed.
Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of
the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's
almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character.
T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round
out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're
all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is
the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something
and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy
nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal
measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and
defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in
special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls
off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this
one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit
together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the
ages.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this
movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it,
'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and
fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has
the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands
the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough
tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien
abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the
desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope
to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the
despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men
must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out
who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it
isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well
and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and
cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early
point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the
Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because
unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right
in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one
of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do,
it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how
the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another,
and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care
about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling
them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which
isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it
doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like
it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at
the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film
without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the
psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the
monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances
and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when
the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it,
it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the
scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of
your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and
turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is
truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall
entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate
organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long
they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks
is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you
just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is
the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the
blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is
so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened
Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a
picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of
practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards
for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn
apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly
unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things'
really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every
last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John
Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but
it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise
it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an
enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no
other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the
presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently
written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome
horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold,
savour it on a long cold night...

A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under
attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it
touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight
against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to
love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly
suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to
a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be
impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out
the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these,
and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test
sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's
secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the
better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its
disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of
intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to
punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to
dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is
unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the
basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles
are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked
technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a
situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage
throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive,
offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and
making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most
impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and
animals-in-peril

Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is
this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing
From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by
a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the
horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John
Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting
and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the
atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best
highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob
Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature
creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25
years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock
and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is
hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and
out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films
and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****


This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion
it
is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you
haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was
very
good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A.
Dysart,
Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed
well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at
keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is
very
interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great
effects!
In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the
space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of
all
time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music
which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is
very
good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this
greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and
the
hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on
the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the
other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling,
suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!
Strongly
recommended!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:I also recommend these John Carpenter films: Big Trouble in Little China,

John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of
Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it
to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original,
Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop
of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation
of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent
as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose
inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear
of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg,
Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic
special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore.
However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in
the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left
with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film
before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how
powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of
oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the
violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects
for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its
systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is
trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and
undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far
more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this
with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates
and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of
human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what
lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic
landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so
effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the
American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge
of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the
location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales
of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who
Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source
material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From
Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled
at this production when it was released at the box-office was in
lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in
comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter
not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his
earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV
set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the
video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian
counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version.
Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its
gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag
movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter
by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the
slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the
shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid
the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably
tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special
effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative
licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his
teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to
Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with
his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still
retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award
nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did
earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away
from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for
Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this
production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could
be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack
of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the
tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt
Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light
comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a
psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter
himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie
together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching
its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also
supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was
so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the
plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this
shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens
the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout
the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien
interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the
breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to
its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in
capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith
David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt
Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to
take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two
characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of
their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on
human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another
perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver
an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines
of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what
happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar
for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office
marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio,
big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both
were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter'
to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences
warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster,
'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it
deserves.

A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is
suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian
research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs
from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US
team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or
missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians
burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien
life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over
and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread
like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by
The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John
Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and
ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could
be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative
and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and
will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't
generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too
much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at
least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I
think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the
lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.

John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo
Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great
movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a
first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of
Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest
masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the
title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such
a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after
Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its
theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything
to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over
the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed
by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell
short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in
Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any
creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its
discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of
the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a
remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World,
which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who
Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable.
Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside
of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on
earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can
live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by
Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from
outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its
reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously
speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never
explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors
and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like
i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.

No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John
Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived
on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the
80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back
then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient
antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a
veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters
and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen
to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic
researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft
buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that
upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an
imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh
and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust,
mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For
me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's
ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians
in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of
the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed.
Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of
the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's
almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character.
T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round
out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're
all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is
the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something
and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy
nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal
measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and
defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in
special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls
off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this
one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit
together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the
ages.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this
movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it,
'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and
fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has
the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands
the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough
tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien
abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the
desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope
to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the
despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men
must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out
who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it
isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well
and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and
cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early
point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the
Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because
unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right
in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one
of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do,
it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how
the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another,
and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care
about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling
them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which
isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it
doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like
it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at
the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film
without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the
psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the
monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances
and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when
the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it,
it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the
scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of
your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and
turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is
truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall
entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate
organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long
they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks
is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you
just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is
the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the
blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is
so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened
Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a
picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of
practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards
for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn
apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly
unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things'
really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every
last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John
Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but
it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise
it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an
enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no
other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the
presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently
written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome
horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold,
savour it on a long cold night...

A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under
attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it
touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight
against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to
love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly
suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to
a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be
impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out
the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these,
and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test
sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's
secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the
better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its
disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of
intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to
punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to
dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is
unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the
basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles
are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked
technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a
situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage
throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive,
offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and
making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most
impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and
animals-in-peril

Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is
this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing
From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by
a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the
horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John
Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting
and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the
atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best
highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob
Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature
creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25
years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock
and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is
hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and
out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films
and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****


This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion
it
is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you
haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was
very
good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A.
Dysart,
Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed
well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at
keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is
very
interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great
effects!
In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the
space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of
all
time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music
which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is
very
good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this
greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and
the
hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on
the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the
other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling,
suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!
Strongly

John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of
Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it
to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original,
Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop
of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation
of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent
as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose
inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear
of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg,
Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic
special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore.
However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in
the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left
with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film
before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how
powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of
oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the
violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects
for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its
systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is
trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and
undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far
more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this
with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates
and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of
human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what
lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10

At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research
party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their
campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is
shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they
head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown
origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to
find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human
parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the
ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon
enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing
strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn
on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it
was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror
genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I
never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed
that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion
I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around.
Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad
timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty
much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly
become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans.
The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly
dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one
of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and
definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New
York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming
before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from
another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W.
Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal
itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural
form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking
resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare
the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for
me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love
the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene
alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about
Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly
revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in
creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are
incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The
gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved.
Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the
paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a
well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and
Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines,
where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I
thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the
overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even
the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy
to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere
that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath
it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's
nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the
chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's
simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers
the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to
what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write
home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his
charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in
this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional,
but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism
factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable.
Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off
alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the
red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can
be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less
stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from
another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on
the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and
sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up
proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the
assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but
authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another
thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty
wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just
makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix
gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational
viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves
you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's
crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the
innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many
years to come.


"The Thing" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's
filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special
effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is
also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter
cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly
humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and
see it now!A must-see!
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the
actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all
setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very
little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much
to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends
for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never
hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry
says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only
one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings
body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the
movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster...
who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying?
After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they
never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling
Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is
always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at
risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only
one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out
flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have
figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they
do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base
with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but
then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the
whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who
thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a
scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the
movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing
they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any),
then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of
the best special effects of its time.

The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the
lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak,
unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing,
based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the
finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien,
another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where
no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown
alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the
sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of
nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other
shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the
pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to
crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable
atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated
by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too
uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best
endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is
told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the
characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien.
There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough
screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good,
like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to
see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually
wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're
not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances
should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good
at what it does.

A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by
men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and
die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this
outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene…John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing
From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the
original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent
use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still
look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that
has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the
sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story.
Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people
that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the
fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio
Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a
frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that
followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to
the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is
the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.

Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to
different from the original and they make it more violent well this
movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this
movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its
john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it
in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but
it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the
body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the
frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a
worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and
i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets
leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I
can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing
being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a
little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special
effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching
it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the
top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this
time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how
bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping
mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I
found it repulsive – I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a
fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs
get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but
my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters – I love David
Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach
turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging
watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So
perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But
they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an
imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself
along – and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its
body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's
the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts
and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man
who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of
shots it's obviously a dummy…which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head
being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its
mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts
antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap.
And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either – the bit
where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and
the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the
end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing
alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and
Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then
after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's
sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable
film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates
in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't
realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing
is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene
where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers
to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's
not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been
assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he
says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally
could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain
he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do
we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too
(they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is
when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp
(he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off
an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching
in the film…which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady
visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit
and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then
begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb
scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the
dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady
thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is
that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation,
and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's
become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an
ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero
and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a
Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.

So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me,
absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T.
is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds
up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell
playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man
should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it
(so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind,
now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up
from me).And that was the review…But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will
continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter
fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first
screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest
screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up
in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole
together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense
atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of
the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I
wasn't going to be disappointed… If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow)
that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to
watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for
this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media
you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph
that this film's first scene brings to its audience…In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!

What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After
establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their
colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable
line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept
me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's
MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to
determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His
methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we
soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill
you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to
accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering
the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well,
and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.
Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still
effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new
generation of moviegoers.

The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and
stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica
and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met
with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however
over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary
status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While
The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the
horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly
dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our
characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of
them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself.
You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character
to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in
The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the
film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be
tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out
film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another
strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of
blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and
wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the
statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all
time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking
horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a
gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some
rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling
incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score
from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic
landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so
effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the
American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge
of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the
location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales
of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who
Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source
material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From
Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled
at this production when it was released at the box-office was in
lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in
comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter
not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his
earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV
set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the
video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian
counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version.
Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its
gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag
movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter
by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the
slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the
shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid
the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably
tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special
effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative
licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his
teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to
Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with
his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still
retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award
nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did
earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away
from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for
Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this
production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could
be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack
of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the
tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt
Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light
comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a
psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter
himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie
together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching
its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also
supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was
so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the
plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this
shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens
the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout
the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien
interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the
breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to
its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in
capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith
David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt
Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to
take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two
characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of
their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on
human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another
perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver
an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines
of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what
happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar
for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office
marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio,
big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both
were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter'
to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences
warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster,
'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it
deserves.

A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is
suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian
research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs
from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US
team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or
missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians
burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien
life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over
and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread
like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by
The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John
Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and
ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could
be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative
and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and
will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't
generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too
much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at
least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I
think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the
lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.

John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo
Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great
movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a
first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of
Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest
masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the
title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such
a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after
Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its
theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything
to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over
the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed
by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell
short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in
Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any
creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its
discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of
the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a
remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World,
which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who
Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable.
Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside
of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on
earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can
live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by
Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from
outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its
reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously
speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never
explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors
and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like
i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.

No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John
Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived
on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the
80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back
then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient
antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a
veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters
and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen
to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic
researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft
buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that
upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an
imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh
and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust,
mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For
me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's
ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians
in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of
the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed.
Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of
the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's
almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character.
T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round
out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're
all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is
the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something
and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy
nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal
measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and
defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in
special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls
off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this
one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit
together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the
ages.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this
movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it,
'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and
fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has
the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands
the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough
tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien
abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the
desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope
to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the
despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men
must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out
who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it
isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well
and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and
cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early
point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the
Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because
unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right
in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one
of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do,
it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how
the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another,
and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care
about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling
them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which
isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it
doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like
it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at
the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film
without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the
psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the
monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances
and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when
the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it,
it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the
scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of
your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and
turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is
truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall
entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate
organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long
they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks
is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you
just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is
the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the
blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is
so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened
Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a
picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of
practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards
for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn
apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly
unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things'
really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every
last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John
Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but
it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise
it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an
enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no
other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the
presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently
written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome
horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold,
savour it on a long cold night...

A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under
attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it
touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight
against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to
love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly
suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to
a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be
impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out
the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these,
and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test
sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's
secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the
better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its
disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of
intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to
punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to
dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is
unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the
basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles
are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked
technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a
situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage
throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive,
offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and
making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most
impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and

Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is
this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing
From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by
a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the
horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John
Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting
and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the
atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best
highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob
Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature
creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25
years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock
and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is
hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and
out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films
and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****


This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion
it
is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you
haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was
very
good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A.
Dysart,
Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed
well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at
keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is
very
interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great
effects!
In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the
space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of
all
time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music
which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is
very
good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this
greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and
the
hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on
the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the
other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling,
suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!
Strongly
recommended!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:I also recommend these John Carpenter films: Big Trouble in Little China,

John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of
Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it
to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original,
Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop
of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation
of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent
as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose
inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear
of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg,
Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic
special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore.
However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in
the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left
with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film
before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how
powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of
oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the
violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects
for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its
systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is
trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and
undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far
more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this
with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates
and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of
human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what
lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10

At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research
party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their
campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is
shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they
head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown
origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to
find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human
parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the
ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon
enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing
strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn
on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it
was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror
genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I
never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed
that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion
I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around.
Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad
timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty
much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly
become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans.
The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly
dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one
of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and
definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New
York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming
before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from
another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W.
Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal
itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural
form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking
resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare
the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for
me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love
the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene
alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about
Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly
revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in
creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are
incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The
gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved.
Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the
paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a
well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and
Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines,
where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I
thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the
overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even
the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy
to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere
that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath
it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's
nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the
chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's
simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers
the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to
what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write
home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his
charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in
this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional,
but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism
factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable.
Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off
alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the
red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can
be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less
stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from
another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on
the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and
sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up
proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the
assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but
authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another
thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty
wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just
makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix
gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational
viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves
you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's
crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the
innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many
years to come.


"The Thing" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's
filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special
effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is
also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter
cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly
humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and
see it now!A must-see!
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the
actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all
setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very
little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much
to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends
for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never
hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry
says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only
one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings
body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the
movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster...
who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying?
After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they
never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling
Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is
always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at
risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only
one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out
flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have
figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they
do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base
with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but
then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the
whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who
thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a
scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the
movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing
they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any),
then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of
the best special effects of its time.

The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the
lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak,
unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing,
based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the
finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien,
another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where
no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown
alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the
sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of
nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other
shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the
pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to
crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable
atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated
by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too
uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best
endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is
told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the
characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien.
There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough
screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good,
like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to
see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually
wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're
not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances
should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good
at what it does.

A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by
men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and
die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this
outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene…John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing
From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the
original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent
use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still
look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that
has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the
sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story.
Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people
that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the
fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio
Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a
frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that
followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to
the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is
the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.

Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to
different from the original and they make it more violent well this
movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this
movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its
john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it
in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but
it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the
body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the
frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a
worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and
i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets
leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I
can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing
being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a
little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special
effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching
it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the
top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this
time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how
bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping
mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I
found it repulsive – I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a
fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs
get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but
my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters – I love David
Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach
turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging
watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So
perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But
they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an
imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself
along – and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its
body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's
the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts
and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man
who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of
shots it's obviously a dummy…which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head
being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its
mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts
antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap.
And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either – the bit
where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and
the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the
end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing
alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and
Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then
after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's
sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable
film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates
in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't
realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing
is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene
where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers
to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's
not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been
assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he
says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally
could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain
he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do
we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too
(they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is
when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp
(he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off
an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching
in the film…which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady
visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit
and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then
begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb
scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the
dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady
thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is
that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation,
and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's
become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an
ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero
and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a
Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.

So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me,
absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T.
is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds
up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell
playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man
should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it
(so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind,
now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up
from me).And that was the review…But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will
continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter
fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first
screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest
screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up
in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole
together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense
atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of
the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I
wasn't going to be disappointed… If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow)
that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to
watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for
this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media
you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph
that this film's first scene brings to its audience…In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!

What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After
establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their
colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable
line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept
me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's
MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to
determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His
methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we
soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill
you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to
accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering
the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well,
and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.
Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still
effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new
generation of moviegoers.

The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and
stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica
and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met
with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however
over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary
status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While
The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the
horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly
dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our
characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of
them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself.
You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character
to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in
The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the
film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be
tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out
film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another
strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of
blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and
wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the
statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all
time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking
horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a
gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some
rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling
incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10

World an adaptation of Campbell's story. The fifties film does an
excellent job of portraying the isolation of the team and their fear
but it lacks the terror and realistic special effects of this remake.
The Thing is a bleak horror film, there is no happy ending to be found
here and in places it is a tough film to watch.Antarctica, 1982 a Norwegian helicopter flies over an American science
base. It becomes apparent that the two men on board are chasing after a
husky that has run into the camp, they are shooting at it and trying to
blow it up. The American commander thinking the base is being attacked
kills one of the crew and the other is killed when the helicopter is
blown up. It is not clear why they wanted to kill the husky and the
team think they must have gone crazy from the isolation at their base.
The husky is put in with the Americans dogs.The American's pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell)and the teams doctor
Dr.Copper(Richard Dysart)fly to the neighbouring Norwegian science base
and what they discover there terrifies them. The base is destroyed and
they find some dead bodies including something that looks half human
and half something else. They bring it back to the base and try and
find out what it is. They conclude it's alien (a suspicion that's
confirmed when they look at some tapes they found at the Norwegian
base), these show that team digging a spaceship out from under the ice
and recovering an alien from the craft.The husky that was being chased is the alien and has taken on the
appearance of the husky. When it's in the kennels it transforms and
tries to assimilate the other dogs into itself. That's prevented by the
team when they hear the disturbance and then everyone comes to realise
they are being threatened by an alien. The film really becomes scary
when they realise that this thing could have assimilated one or more of
them and someone in the team may not be human after all. The team no
longer knows if they can trust one another or not and have to try and
uncover the alien among them.The entire cast are superb especially Russell as the heroic Macready.
Wilford Brimley is also memorable as the scientist who realises that
the team can't in all good conscience leave the base because they could
take the thing back to civilisation and it could infect the population.Ennio Morricone's chilling score that sounds like a heartbeat really
adds to the horror atmosphere and the special effects help make the
story realistic. As with Alien (1979)not using computer effects but
physical things that the actors can interact with and that look real
gives the film a realistic look. You get scared because what you're
seeing looks so real.The films ambiguous ending and realistic effects have no doubt helped
the film achieve the fame it has today and both are quite the talking
point. The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made and is a
must see.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low
expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for
which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog?
What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American
base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more
important question: which of these men have been infected by the
titular "thing?"Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and
question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying
to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside
of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied
motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly
stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not
unlike "And Then There Were None." One thing bothered me in this film:
remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of
writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity
could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and
this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just
found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while
the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a
double until they ultimately perish.

When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond
terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a
shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30
years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore,
but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful
classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more
influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie – no frigging
contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s
and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas
were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies
like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young
directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the
medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free
to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the
film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is
almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads,
other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The
cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors
were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are
no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset
to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the
introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's
visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen
time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical
effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that
has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a
wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and
because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent
2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part
because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech
cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a
helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one
of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately.
There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing,
you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds
almost like a Lovecraftian version of "Ten Little Indians". Once The
Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with
tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation
of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the
scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only
ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent,
the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best
jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to
about a half dozen people, and the "test" scene has made somebody jump
out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of
characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound,
and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost
immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that
there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy
who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the
doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big
tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a
body count, every death feels significant, because even minor
characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies
ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has
such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release,
and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy
it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the
true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as
"horror"), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.

John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film
ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special
effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror
film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time
favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in
Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover
that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and
killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you
trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a
bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven
Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take
on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by
critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now
considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and
the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many
reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of
the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects
is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop
trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and
Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will
come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The
film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and
atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the
alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film
it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known
around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though
The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and
distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill
Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters
great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who
they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't
paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the
dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel
isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where
to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the
chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both
films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set
in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel
by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of
the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the
original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien
was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film
looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and
different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and
terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse
trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness
and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have
nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they
all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing
is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline
themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many
years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until
the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal
truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens
you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The
Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the
ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy
answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all
time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly
brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is
excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things
fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes
crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald
Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role.
T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard
Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles
Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter
Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is
always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and
doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by
Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the
dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most
ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history.
Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard
for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic
that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in
every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's
greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows
how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi
chiller "The Thing from Another World" about an alien that tangles with
a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out.
Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster
went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella "Who Goes
There?" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the
colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not
for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter
that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes.
"The Thing" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and
probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising,
and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while
he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense,
humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens
with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept
terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before
they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy
Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before
long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and
tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and
wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of
suspenseful situations.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This is the classic John Carpenter re-visitation/tribute to the
original 'The Thing From Another World' which was adapted from John W.
Campbell's book, 'Who Goes There?', and it begins like a slick and
subtle action in the Antarctic movie just before it gradually develops
into a spectacle of mind-blowing special effects and paranoid tension.Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley are among the occupants
of a remote research station in the Antarctic when they discover the
remains of an alien creature frozen in the ice that is able to
assimilate any living organism by reproducing its cell-structure. This
premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an
overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The
Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the
most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this
day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever
made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a
feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script
focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most
memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the
alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs
in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget
to mention the infamous "spider head" scene which for many is the
film's most gruesome highlight. This is one of the great films that
forged itself timelessly from the world of nightmares and unknown
horrors, and will remain as a major contribution to monster effects
history.

This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as
near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast,
the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror
film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This
movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say
there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of
dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from
the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable
horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The
imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to
a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work
here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in
to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's
release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their
heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was
awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast
members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this
movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this
monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror
(particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the
earliest opportunity.

It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the
big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's
cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly
Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a
helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky
with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the
passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing
the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research
team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot
down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered
crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to
be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel
who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian
base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned
base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had
been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like
something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to
the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes
the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of
the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the
creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team.
When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and
looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and
hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of
the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members?
Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even
feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the
darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect
another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person
is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by
Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance
in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization,
it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him
over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of
mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's
original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite
an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a
shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that
required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John
Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the
original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?'
by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting
creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact
the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or
personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers
in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in
'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous
for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his
movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced,
well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don
Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956,
where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his
claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to
be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature
the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of
showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and
gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special
effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's
version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia
and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure
to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in
the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the
phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its
extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an "R" rating by the
Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a
cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest
horror films ever made.

Once you finish reading this I want you to do the following: Turn your
computer off. Save all the files that need to be saved. Put your shoes
on, grab your wallet and your keys. Get out of your house and find the
closest rental store or DVD store. Simply go in Buy or rent John
Carpenter's The Thing and walk out. There's really no need of getting a
second movie. Get back home, disconnect your phone, turn off your
cellphone and turn all your lights off. Make sure you are alone, no
girl/boyfriend, no best friend, no parents. Watch it. This may seem
like a ridiculous review right now but trust me, once the credits pop
up, you will be thanking me I wrote these instructions for you. Enjoy
the night10/10

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score
from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic
landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so
effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the
American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge
of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the
location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales
of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who
Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source
material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From
Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled
at this production when it was released at the box-office was in
lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in
comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter
not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his
earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV
set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the
video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian
counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version.
Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its
gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag
movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter
by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the
slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the
shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid
the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably
tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special
effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative
licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his
teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to
Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with
his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still
retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award
nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did
earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away
from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for
Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this
production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could
be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack
of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the
tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt
Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light
comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a
psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter
himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie
together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching
its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also
supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was
so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the
plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this
shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens
the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout
the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien
interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the
breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to
its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in
capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith
David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt
Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to
take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two
characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of
their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on
human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another
perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver
an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines
of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what
happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar
for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office
marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio,
big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both
were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter'
to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences
warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster,
'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it
deserves.

A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is
suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian
research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs
from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US
team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or
missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians
burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien
life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over
and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread
like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by
The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John
Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and
ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could
be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative
and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and
will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't
generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too
much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at
least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I
think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the
lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.

John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo
Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great
movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a
first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of
Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest
masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the
title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such
a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after
Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its
theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything
to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over
the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed
by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell
short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in
Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any
creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its
discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of
the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a
remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World,
which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who
Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable.
Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside
of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on
earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can
live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by
Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from
outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its
reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously
speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never
explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors
and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like
i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.

No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John
Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived
on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the
80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back
then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient
antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a
veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters
and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen
to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic
researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft
buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that
upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an
imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh
and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust,
mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For
me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's
ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians
in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of
the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed.
Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of
the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's
almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character.
T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round
out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're
all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is
the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something
and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy
nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal
measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and
defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in
special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls
off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this
one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit
together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the
ages.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this
movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it,
'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and
fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has
the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands
the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough
tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien
abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the
desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope
to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the
despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men
must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out
who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it
isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well
and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and
cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early
point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the
Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because
unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right
in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one
of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do,
it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how
the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another,
and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care
about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling
them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which
isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it
doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like
it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at
the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film
without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the
psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the
monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances
and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when
the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it,
it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the
scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of
your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and
turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is
truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall
entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate
organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long
they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks
is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you
just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is
the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the
blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is
so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened
Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a
picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of
practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards
for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn
apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly
unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things'
really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every
last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John
Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but
it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise
it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an
enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no
other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the
presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently
written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome
horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold,
savour it on a long cold night...

A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under
attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it
touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight
against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to
love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly
suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to
a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be
impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out
the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these,
and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test
sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's
secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the
better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its
disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of
intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to
punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to
dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is
unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the
basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles
are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked
technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a
situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage
throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive,
offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and
making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most
impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and
animals-in-peril

Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is
this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing
From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by
a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the
horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John
Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting
and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the
atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best
highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob
Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature
creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25
years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock
and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is
hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and
out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films
and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****


This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion
it
is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you
haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was
very
good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A.
Dysart,
Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed
well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at
keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is
very
interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great
effects!
In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the
space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of
all
time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music
which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is
very
good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this
greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and
the
hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on
the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the
other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling,
suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!
Strongly

John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of
Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it
to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original,
Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop
of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation
of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent
as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose
inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear
of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg,
Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic
special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore.
However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in
the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left
with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film
before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how
powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of
oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the
violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects
for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its
systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is
trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and
undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far
more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this
with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates
and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of
human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what
lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10

At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research
party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their
campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is
shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they
head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown
origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to
find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human
parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the
ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon
enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing
strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn
on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it
was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror
genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I
never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed
that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion
I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around.
Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad
timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty
much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly
become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans.
The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly
dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one
of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and
definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New
York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming
before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from
another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W.
Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal
itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural
form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking
resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare
the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for
me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love
the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene
alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about
Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly
revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in
creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are
incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The
gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved.
Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the
paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a
well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and
Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines,
where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I
thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the
overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even
the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy
to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere
that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath
it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's
nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the
chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's
simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers
the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to
what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write
home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his
charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in
this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional,
but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism
factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable.
Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off
alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the
red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can
be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less
stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from
another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on
the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and
sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up
proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the
assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but
authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another
thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty
wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just
makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix
gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational
viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves
you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's
crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the
innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many
years to come.


"The Thing" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's
filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special
effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is
also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter
cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly
humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and
see it now!A must-see!
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the
actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all
setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very
little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much
to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends
for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never
hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry
says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only
one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings
body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the
movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster...
who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying?
After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they
never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling
Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is
always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at
risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only
one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out
flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have
figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they
do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base
with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but
then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the
whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who
thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a
scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the
movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing
they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any),
then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of
the best special effects of its time.

The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the
lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak,
unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing,
based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the
finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien,
another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where
no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown
alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the
sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of
nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other
shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the
pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to
crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable
atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated
by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too
uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best
endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is
told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the
characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien.
There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough
screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good,
like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to
see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually
wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're
not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances
should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good
at what it does.

A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by
men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and
die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this
outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene…John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing
From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the
original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent
use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still
look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that
has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the
sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story.
Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people
that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the
fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio
Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a
frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that
followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to
the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is
the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.

Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to
different from the original and they make it more violent well this
movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this
movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its
john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it
in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but
it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the
body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the
frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a
worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and
i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets
leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I
can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing
being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a
little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special
effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching
it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the
top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this
time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how
bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping
mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I
found it repulsive – I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a
fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs
get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but
my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters – I love David
Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach
turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging
watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So
perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But
they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an
imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself
along – and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its
body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's
the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts
and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man
who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of
shots it's obviously a dummy…which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head
being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its
mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts
antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap.
And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either – the bit
where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and
the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the
end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing
alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and
Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then
after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's
sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable
film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates
in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't
realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing
is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene
where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers
to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's
not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been
assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he
says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally
could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain
he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do
we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too
(they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is
when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp
(he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off
an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching
in the film…which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady
visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit
and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then
begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb
scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the
dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady
thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is
that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation,
and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's
become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an
ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero
and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a
Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.

So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me,
absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T.
is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds
up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell
playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man
should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it
(so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind,
now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up
from me).And that was the review…But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will
continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter
fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first
screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest
screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up
in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole
together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense
atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of
the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I
wasn't going to be disappointed… If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow)
that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to
watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for
this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media
you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph
that this film's first scene brings to its audience…In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!

What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After
establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their
colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable
line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept
me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's
MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to
determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His
methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we
soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill
you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to
accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering
the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well,
and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.
Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still
effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new
generation of moviegoers.

The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and
stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica
and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met
with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however
over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary
status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While
The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the
horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly
dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our
characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of
them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself.
You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character
to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in
The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the
film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be
tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out
film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another
strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of
blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and
wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the
statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all
time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking
horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a
gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some
rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling
incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10

The Thing is directed by John Carpenter, has a screenplay by John
Lancaster, is based on the novel Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell
Jr, has music by Ennio Morricone and stars Kurt Russell, Richard
Dysart, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, T.K Carter, Peter Maloney, Thomas
G. Waites, Richard Masur, Joel Polis and Donald Moffatt.Carpenter's film is a remake of the 1951 film The Thing From Another
World an adaptation of Campbell's story. The fifties film does an
excellent job of portraying the isolation of the team and their fear
but it lacks the terror and realistic special effects of this remake.
The Thing is a bleak horror film, there is no happy ending to be found
here and in places it is a tough film to watch.Antarctica, 1982 a Norwegian helicopter flies over an American science
base. It becomes apparent that the two men on board are chasing after a
husky that has run into the camp, they are shooting at it and trying to
blow it up. The American commander thinking the base is being attacked
kills one of the crew and the other is killed when the helicopter is
blown up. It is not clear why they wanted to kill the husky and the
team think they must have gone crazy from the isolation at their base.
The husky is put in with the Americans dogs.The American's pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell)and the teams doctor
Dr.Copper(Richard Dysart)fly to the neighbouring Norwegian science base
and what they discover there terrifies them. The base is destroyed and
they find some dead bodies including something that looks half human
and half something else. They bring it back to the base and try and
find out what it is. They conclude it's alien (a suspicion that's
confirmed when they look at some tapes they found at the Norwegian
base), these show that team digging a spaceship out from under the ice
and recovering an alien from the craft.The husky that was being chased is the alien and has taken on the
appearance of the husky. When it's in the kennels it transforms and
tries to assimilate the other dogs into itself. That's prevented by the
team when they hear the disturbance and then everyone comes to realise
they are being threatened by an alien. The film really becomes scary
when they realise that this thing could have assimilated one or more of
them and someone in the team may not be human after all. The team no
longer knows if they can trust one another or not and have to try and
uncover the alien among them.The entire cast are superb especially Russell as the heroic Macready.
Wilford Brimley is also memorable as the scientist who realises that
the team can't in all good conscience leave the base because they could
take the thing back to civilisation and it could infect the population.Ennio Morricone's chilling score that sounds like a heartbeat really
adds to the horror atmosphere and the special effects help make the
story realistic. As with Alien (1979)not using computer effects but
physical things that the actors can interact with and that look real
gives the film a realistic look. You get scared because what you're
seeing looks so real.The films ambiguous ending and realistic effects have no doubt helped
the film achieve the fame it has today and both are quite the talking
point. The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made and is a
must see.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low
expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for
which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog?
What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American
base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more
important question: which of these men have been infected by the
titular "thing?"Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and
question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying
to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside
of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied
motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly
stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not
unlike "And Then There Were None." One thing bothered me in this film:
remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of
writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity
could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and
this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just
found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while
the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a
double until they ultimately perish.

When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond
terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a
shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30
years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore,
but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful
classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more
influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie – no frigging
contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s
and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas
were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies
like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young
directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the
medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free
to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the
film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is
almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads,
other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The
cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors
were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are
no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset
to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the
introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's
visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen
time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical
effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that
has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a
wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and
because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent
2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part
because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech
cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a
helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one
of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately.
There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing,
you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds
almost like a Lovecraftian version of "Ten Little Indians". Once The
Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with
tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation
of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the
scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only
ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent,
the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best
jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to
about a half dozen people, and the "test" scene has made somebody jump
out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of
characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound,
and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost
immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that
there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy
who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the
doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big
tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a
body count, every death feels significant, because even minor
characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies
ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has
such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release,
and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy
it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the
true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as
"horror"), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.

John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film
ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special
effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror
film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time
favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in
Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover
that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and
killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you
trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a
bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven
Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take
on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by
critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now
considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and
the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many
reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of
the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects
is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop
trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and
Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will
come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The
film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and
atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the
alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film
it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known
around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though
The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and
distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill
Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters
great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who
they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't
paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the
dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel
isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where
to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the
chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both
films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set
in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel
by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of
the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the
original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien
was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film
looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and
different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and
terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse
trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness
and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have
nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they
all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing
is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline
themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many
years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until
the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal
truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens
you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The
Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the
ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy
answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all
time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly
brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is
excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things
fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes
crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald
Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role.
T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard
Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles
Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter
Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is
always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and
doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by
Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the
dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most
ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history.
Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard
for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic
that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in
every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's
greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows
how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi
chiller "The Thing from Another World" about an alien that tangles with
a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out.
Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster
went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella "Who Goes
There?" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the
colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not
for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter
that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes.
"The Thing" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and
probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising,
and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while
he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense,
humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens
with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept
terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before
they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy
Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before
long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and
tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and
wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of
suspenseful situations.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This is the classic John Carpenter re-visitation/tribute to the
original 'The Thing From Another World' which was adapted from John W.
Campbell's book, 'Who Goes There?', and it begins like a slick and
subtle action in the Antarctic movie just before it gradually develops
into a spectacle of mind-blowing special effects and paranoid tension.Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley are among the occupants
of a remote research station in the Antarctic when they discover the
remains of an alien creature frozen in the ice that is able to
assimilate any living organism by reproducing its cell-structure. This
premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an
overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The
Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the
most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this
day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever
made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a
feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script
focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most
memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the
alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs
in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget
to mention the infamous "spider head" scene which for many is the
film's most gruesome highlight. This is one of the great films that
forged itself timelessly from the world of nightmares and unknown
horrors, and will remain as a major contribution to monster effects
history.

This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as
near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast,
the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror
film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This
movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say
there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of
dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from
the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable
horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The
imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to
a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work
here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in
to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's
release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their
heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was
awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast
members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this
movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this
monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror
(particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the
earliest opportunity.

It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the
big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's
cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly
Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a
helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky
with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the
passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing
the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research
team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot
down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered
crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to
be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel
who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian
base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned
base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had
been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like
something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to
the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes
the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of
the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the
creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team.
When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and
looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and
hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of
the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members?
Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even
feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the
darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect
another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person
is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by
Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance
in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization,
it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him
over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of
mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's
original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite
an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a
shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that
required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John
Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the
original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?'
by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting
creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact
the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or
personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers
in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in
'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous
for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his
movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced,
well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don
Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956,
where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his
claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to
be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature
the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of
showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and
gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special
effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's
version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia
and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure
to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in
the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the
phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its
extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an "R" rating by the
Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a
cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest
horror films ever made.

Once you finish reading this I want you to do the following: Turn your
computer off. Save all the files that need to be saved. Put your shoes
on, grab your wallet and your keys. Get out of your house and find the
closest rental store or DVD store. Simply go in Buy or rent John
Carpenter's The Thing and walk out. There's really no need of getting a
second movie. Get back home, disconnect your phone, turn off your
cellphone and turn all your lights off. Make sure you are alone, no
girl/boyfriend, no best friend, no parents. Watch it. This may seem
like a ridiculous review right now but trust me, once the credits pop
up, you will be thanking me I wrote these instructions for you. Enjoy
the night10/10

I think this is one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. The setting
is brilliant, the isolation is total and the paranoia feels believable.
The creature itself without giving too much away has a very simple and
understandable desire to survive. You can imagine if it had ended up
somewhere less remote and although you get little information about its
origins it doesn't matter because like the aliens in the movie Aliens
you know enough about it to know it's damn scary.The effects have held up fairly well, there are bits that still make me
jump but the point is that it's a very well told story and the
characters are likable and though thinly sketched also feel like real
people. I loved this movie and I have watched it many times since it
came out, if you haven't seen it then treat yourself to a night of
quality entertainment.I'd rate this gem as highly as Aliens, it's simply brilliant and the
dogs acting easily beats most of Hollywoods current 'talent' hands or
paws down.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and
difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica.
Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a
station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even
more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with
anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and
lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of
paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the
unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual
situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying
to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting
everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there.
And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the
Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was
defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great
information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to
imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying
to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film
begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has
a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter
pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think
about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to
survive just like them. The last part is just great with the "still
humans" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope
that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they
can do is to wait there for a little while…see what happens."The Thing" was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was
released just after "E.T." back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure
but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of
course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is
also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape
from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest
of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the
entire cast.Conclusion: "The Thing" is just another great film of John Carpenter
that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases.
In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the
classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels & sequels, mixes between two
films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter
film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the
thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake
where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad
taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in
this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc
collector's edition of "The Thing". It contains many bonus materials:
the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary "John
Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" (the only problem with this
documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic
director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with
the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast,
Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location
Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and
full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters),
Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer. THAT'S A
DVD!

- A helicopter chases a husky across the frozen landscape of
Antarctica. The two Norwegians chasing the dog seem intent on killing
it. The dog makes a bee-line for the American science station in what
appears to be an attempt to seek safety. But is that really the dog's
purpose? The Americans discover the dog's true mission only after it's
too late.- I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I hadn't seen The Thing since
its initial theatrical run. Because so much of the movie had slowly
slipped from my memory, I have never placed it on a "favorites" list
(until now). In fact, I had forgotten more of the movie than I
remembered. I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my
third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of
the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never
lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.- If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special
effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and
an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob
Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on
The Thing.- But it takes more than effects and gore to make a "good" movie. It's
the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of
mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved.
These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with
little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere.
But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various
members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save
their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.- As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many
movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question
raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it
does answers. Good call, Carpenter! - I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much
on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try
as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really
appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these
men are. The characters can be described as paper thin. The 1951 movie
was more character driven, and as a result, I cared more for the
characters.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard
Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and
camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a
variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances
that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military
in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John
Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not
exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by
John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body
Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature "infects" others and takes on
their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept,
but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in
crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the
viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some
Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a
group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the
Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American
facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of
the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who
has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out.
Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his
thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no
discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a
capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even
lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne
imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled
testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a
distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into
cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already
relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their
assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot,
character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention
is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show
extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into
the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its
guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the
kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The
dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody
rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of
quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal
writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure,
when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the
1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this
sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another
chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro,
chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their
own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would
have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this
initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this
depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose
thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he
makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There
is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all
unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who
The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than
because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter
tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to
have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation
and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem
to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf
Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together
and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even
the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst
the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one
is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing
that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world
would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then
again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would
be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics
talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing
could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film
was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical
reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to
consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting
should trump storytelling.

American researchers at an Antarctic outpost find themselves faced with
a shape-shifting alien that can assume the form of any person or animal
it absorbs. The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is
just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would
say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally.
It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the
bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more
closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which
was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.The Thing boasts one of the strongest casts of any movie made in the
last forty years. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Kurt Russell's
MacReady is one of his best roles. Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart,
Keith David, Richard Masur, and on down the line are great actors.
Everybody gives their all. John Carpenter's direction is excellent.
It's been said by many that it's his best work. It's really hard to
argue with that. Surprisingly, he doesn't do the score for this one.
Instead the great Ennio Morricone scores it but does so in a manner
very similar to what Carpenter himself might have done. Rob Bottin's
special effects are terrifically fun in the way only old school effects
could be. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a
classic. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. If you
haven't, what are you waiting for?

The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious,
thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in
the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the
appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect
and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the
tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy
chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All
actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is
loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open
ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why
there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they
could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror
classic.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
It's a pleasure to review this movie as I have seen it so many times.
Even more so, since recently I showed it to my 21 year old friend for
the first time. Had you been there for the amount of "NOOOO", (Gasps),
"WHAT" & "OH MY GOD" reactions, all of which left me in tears. It
proves that John Carpenter's gross out remake of this 1950's Sci-Fi
classic, continues to work its magic even today.Based on the short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell. A group
of researchers in Antarctica, stumble across an alien life form at an
abandoned post. You never fully see it, and it can assimilate its host
whilst picking them off one by one. From there on tension rises, and
trusts are tested. Leading to some of the most jaw dropping, gruesome
creature effects ever committed to cinema.Watching this recently in the Blu-ray format, just shows how timeless
this movie really is. Kurt Russell brings us an incredibly likable
anti-hero, whose most prominent scene stealing moment is the legendary
"Blood Test" scene. All this with Rob Bottin's spectacular creature
effects, and Ennio Morricone's tense heart beating soundtrack paints
"Antarctica" as if it was another planet (Actually frozen sound stages
in Los Angeles, and British Columbia).Final Verdict: "Halloween" (1978) is a classic, but "The Thing" is John
Carpenter's masterpiece. It continues to remain superior, regardless of
any recent sequel-prequel homages. 9/10. Brilliant Sci-fi Horror.

Over the last several years remakes have been a big money maker. This
is especially true of the Horror genre. Most genre buffs would say this
trend must go, but the studios keep churning them out. It's not that
remakes of classic films is a new thing, but until now few found much
success. One of famed director John Carpenter's biggest influences is
the late director Howard Hawks. You can find many homages and
references to Hawk's work in many of Carpenter's films.Now apparently Hawks wasn't as involved with the original 'The Thing'
as originally thought, but still his presence must show in it
somewhere. Carpenter had success with nearly every film before this one
and after Sci-Fi/Horror hits like 'Alien' you'd think people would have
flocked to Carpenter's version of 'The Thing.' Instead the film
performed poorly at the Box Office and wasn't exactly a hit with
critics either. But over the years, like some of the director's other
works, the film has gained a strong following. This was the first time
I've seen the film in it's entirety and personally I just can't see
what could have kept it from reaching success.Pros: Good work from the ensemble cast. Breathtaking cinematography and
scenery. Startling and impressive effects. Perfect and claustrophobic
setting. Some really creepy moments and images that you won't be able
to shake. After a slow start, the paces moves along. An excellent and
at times chilling score that was undeserved of it's Razzie nomination.
As usual Carpenter does a great job of creating suspense and tension.Cons: Characters could have used some more developing. Anticlimactic
ending.Final thoughts: Though perhaps not Carpenter's greatest achievement,
this film is none the less a solid piece of scary entertainment. Few
films of this kind today have the effect this one does. It's held up
very well and is the kind of film you may not want to watch at night
alone. A real skin crawler from one of the masters.My rating: 4/5

On my mission to watch the IMDb top 250 I have only recently delved
into the horror genre and I have been surprised in how much I have
enjoyed them. I had watched Psycho (9/10) a while ago but in succession
I have watched "The Shining" (10/10), "The Thing" (9/10) and "Alien"
(7/10) in that order. One of the criticisms which annoys me greatly
about "The Thing" is that is lends itself far too much on the success
of "Alien". I don't think it lends itself to "Alien" at all and I hope
to explain why this very similar film is superior. The characters and performances are spectacular from everyone involved
and are the most three dimensional I have seen in such a large cast. In
most horror films (including "Alien") not all of the characters need to
be unique and relatable- especially the weaker, more expendable
characters. In "The Thing" EVERY character is important, not just to
increase the viewer's investment in the characters and their horrifying
situation but the whole plot and concept of the film is dependent on
it. The thing imitates other lifeforms so characters need to be fleshed
out to make the thing as scary as it is in its ability to perfectly
confuse the humans as to what it is. The paranoia, the sense of
isolation, the sense of claustrophobia and the sense of innate fear is
palpable at all times in the film by watching the genuinely enthralling
events occur. There is great variety in terms of characters- even
before the thing appears- which is incredibly interesting to see it
develop. We see MacReady assume leadership and the doubts over it, we
see Gary's leadership deteriorate, we see Blair's madness, we see Clark
deal with constant accusations, we see Child's aggression and
stubbornness. This is to acknowledge just a few of the more pertinent
characters who have layers of depth as the film progresses. The
unmentioned characters would be particularly notable if they were in
any other horror film but they are even dwarfed by the main cast in
"The Thing" showing how great it is. To say that "The Thing" copied
"Alien" by having an alien attack an isolated large crew of relatable
characters is wildly false- especially when this is a remake of the
1951 and adopted from a short story. Even if it is inspired by "Alien"
it is superior to the film in terms of characters which is largely due
to their unique situation of an alien that imitates your closest
friends thus adding far more nuance to each individual. The film is far more tense that any film I have seen- including
"Alien". There is a constant sense of threat because the people who you
are friends with and depend on for survival in numbers include things
which are trying to kill you. I don't know what's scarier; being in a
group of people knowing that at least one is a thing waiting to kill
you or being alone knowing that there is a thing out there who is
trying to kill you but nobody is there to help. Its utter genius in my
opinion and, again, far more nuanced than "Alien" where there is
essentially just a predator in a spaceship who is trying to kill all of
the crew- you feel safer in the group but not on your own which already
cuts the fear factor in half. Then there is the fact that in "Alien"
there is surprisingly little conflict between the humans and alien
unless the people are alone and/or looking to come into contact with
the alien. In fact there is little physical opposition to the "Alien"-
nobody attacks the alien to test its strength unlike in "The Thing"
where flamethrowers are used throughout. In "The Thing" there is a
constant evolving and escalating situation; the humans defeat a thing
and get the upper hand until another thing assimilates another human
and shifts the balance. In alien its a predictable one-way street and
the outcome is visible a mile away. In "The Thing" we see an incredibly
good ending which is highly ambiguous and adds richly to the complexity
of the film. The Thing in short is infinitely more complex and cerebral
then "Alien". I haven't even mentioned Ennio Morricone's fantastic
pulsating claustrophobic score which helps to heightens the tension.
That being said the periods of silence in the film are also extremely
welcome and effective. The use of practical effects in this film are simply phenomenal and,
whilst alien has some good effects whenever the alien is present on the
rare occasion, is far better than "Alien" or any contemporary. its a
shame that we don't have practical effects like this anymore and rely
too heavily on CGI- it so much less realistic. The direction is great
from horror legend John Carpenter and, although this is my first film
of his, I can't imagine that he has made a better film. In short this
film is fantastic and needs to be seen, I am tempted to go back and
give it a 10/10 but I'll save that decision until I venture onto my
first reviewing.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I
actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it
Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy.
This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story "Who Goes There?",
which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which
saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter
is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting
alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has
nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting
and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in
the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable
body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off
bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel
transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a
boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that
one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of
the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a
plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not
to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which
Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent
blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests
their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great
and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so
believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst,
crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to
care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario
imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super
movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for
yourself.

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic
landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so
effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the
American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge
of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the
location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales
of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who
Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source
material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From
Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled
at this production when it was released at the box-office was in
lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in
comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter
not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his
earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV
set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the
video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian
counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version.
Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its
gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag
movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter
by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the
slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the
shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid
the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably
tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special
effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative
licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his
teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to
Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with
his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still
retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award
nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did
earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away
from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for
Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this
production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could
be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack
of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the
tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt
Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light
comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a
psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter
himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie
together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching
its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also
supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was
so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the
plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this
shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens
the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout
the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien
interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the
breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to
its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in
capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith
David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt
Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to
take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two
characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of
their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on
human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another
perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver
an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines
of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what
happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar
for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office
marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio,
big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both
were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter'
to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences
warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster,
'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it
deserves.

A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is
suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian
research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs
from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US
team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or
missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians
burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien
life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over
and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread
like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by
The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John
Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and
ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could
be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative
and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and
will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't
generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too
much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at
least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I
think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the
lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.

John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo
Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great
movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a
first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of
Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest
masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the
title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such
a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after
Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its
theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything
to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over
the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed
by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell
short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in
Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any
creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its
discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of
the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a
remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World,
which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who
Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable.
Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside
of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on
earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can
live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by
Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from
outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its
reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously
speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never
explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors
and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like
i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.

No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John
Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived
on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the
80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back
then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient
antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a
veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters
and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen
to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic
researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft
buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that
upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an
imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh
and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust,
mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For
me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's
ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians
in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of
the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed.
Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of
the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's
almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character.
T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round
out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're
all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is
the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something
and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy
nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal
measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and
defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in
special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls
off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this
one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit
together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the
ages.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this
movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it,
'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and
fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has
the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands
the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough
tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien
abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the
desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope
to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the
despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men
must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out
who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it
isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well
and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and
cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early
point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the
Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because
unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right
in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one
of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do,
it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how
the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another,
and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care
about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling
them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which
isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it
doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like
it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at
the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film
without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the
psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the
monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances
and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when
the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it,
it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the
scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of
your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and
turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is
truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall
entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate
organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long
they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks
is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you
just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is
the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the
blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is
so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened
Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a
picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of
practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards
for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn
apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly
unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things'
really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every
last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John
Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but
it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise
it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an
enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no
other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the
presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently
written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome
horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold,
savour it on a long cold night...

A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under
attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it
touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight
against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to
love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly
suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to
a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be
impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out
the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these,
and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test
sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's
secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the
better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its
disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of
intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to
punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to
dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is
unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the
basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles
are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked
technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a
situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage
throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive,
offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and
making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most
impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and
animals-in-peril

Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is
this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing
From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by
a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the
horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John
Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting
and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the
atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best
highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob
Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature
creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25
years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock
and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is
hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and
out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films
and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****


This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion
it
is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you
haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was
very
good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A.
Dysart,
Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed
well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at
keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is
very
interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great
effects!
In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the
space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of
all
time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music
which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is
very
good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this
greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and
the
hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on
the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the
other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling,
suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!

John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of
Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it
to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original,
Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop
of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation
of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent
as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose
inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear
of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg,
Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic
special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore.
However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in
the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left
with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10

The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film
before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how
powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of
oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the
violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects
for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its
systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is
trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and
undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far
more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this
with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates
and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of
human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what
lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10

At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research
party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their
campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is
shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they
head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown
origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to
find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human
parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the
ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon
enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing
strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn
on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it
was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror
genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I
never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed
that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion
I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around.
Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad
timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty
much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly
become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans.
The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly
dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one
of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and
definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New
York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming
before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from
another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W.
Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal
itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural
form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking
resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare
the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for
me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love
the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene
alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about
Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly
revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in
creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are
incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The
gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved.
Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the
paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a
well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and
Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines,
where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I
thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the
overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even
the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy
to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere
that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath
it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's
nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the
chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's
simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers
the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to
what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write
home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his
charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in
this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional,
but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism
factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable.
Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off
alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the
red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can
be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less
stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from
another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on
the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and
sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up
proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the
assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but
authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another
thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty
wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just
makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix
gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational
viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves
you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's
crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the
innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many
years to come.


"The Thing" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's
filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special
effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is
also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter
cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly
humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and
see it now!A must-see!
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the
actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all
setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very
little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much
to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends
for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never
hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry
says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only
one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings
body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the
movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster...
who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying?
After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they
never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling
Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is
always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at
risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only
one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out
flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have
figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they
do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base
with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but
then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the
whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who
thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a
scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the
movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing
they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any),
then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of
the best special effects of its time.

The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the
lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak,
unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing,
based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the
finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien,
another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where
no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown
alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the
sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of
nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other
shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the
pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to
crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable
atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated
by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too
uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best
endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is
told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the
characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien.
There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough
screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good,
like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to
see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually
wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're
not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances
should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good
at what it does.

A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by
men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and
die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this
outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene…John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing
From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the
original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent
use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still
look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that
has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the
sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story.
Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people
that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the
fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio
Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a
frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that
followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to
the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is
the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.

Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to
different from the original and they make it more violent well this
movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this
movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its
john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it
in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but
it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the
body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the
frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a
worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and
i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets
leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I
can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing
being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a
little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special
effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching
it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the
top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this
time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how
bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping
mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I
found it repulsive – I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a
fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs
get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but
my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters – I love David
Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach
turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging
watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So
perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But
they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an
imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself
along – and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its
body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's
the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts
and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man
who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of
shots it's obviously a dummy…which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head
being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its
mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts
antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap.
And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either – the bit
where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and
the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the
end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing
alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and
Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then
after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's
sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable
film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates
in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't
realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing
is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene
where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers
to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's
not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been
assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he
says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally
could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain
he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do
we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too
(they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is
when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp
(he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off
an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching
in the film…which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady
visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit
and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then
begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb
scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the
dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady
thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is
that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation,
and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's
become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an
ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero
and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a
Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.

So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me,
absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T.
is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds
up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell
playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man
should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it
(so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind,
now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up
from me).And that was the review…But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will
continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter
fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first
screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest
screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up
in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole
together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense
atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of
the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I
wasn't going to be disappointed… If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow)
that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to
watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for
this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media
you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph
that this film's first scene brings to its audience…In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!

What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After
establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their
colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable
line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept
me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's
MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to
determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His
methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we
soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill
you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to
accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering
the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well,
and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.
Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still
effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new
generation of moviegoers.

The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and
stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica
and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met
with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however
over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary
status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While
The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the
horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly
dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our
characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of
them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself.
You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character
to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in
The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the
film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be
tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out
film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another
strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of
blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and
wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the
statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all
time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking
horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a
gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some
rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling
incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10

The Thing is directed by John Carpenter, has a screenplay by John
Lancaster, is based on the novel Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell
Jr, has music by Ennio Morricone and stars Kurt Russell, Richard
Dysart, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, T.K Carter, Peter Maloney, Thomas
G. Waites, Richard Masur, Joel Polis and Donald Moffatt.Carpenter's film is a remake of the 1951 film The Thing From Another
World an adaptation of Campbell's story. The fifties film does an
excellent job of portraying the isolation of the team and their fear
but it lacks the terror and realistic special effects of this remake.
The Thing is a bleak horror film, there is no happy ending to be found
here and in places it is a tough film to watch.Antarctica, 1982 a Norwegian helicopter flies over an American science
base. It becomes apparent that the two men on board are chasing after a
husky that has run into the camp, they are shooting at it and trying to
blow it up. The American commander thinking the base is being attacked
kills one of the crew and the other is killed when the helicopter is
blown up. It is not clear why they wanted to kill the husky and the
team think they must have gone crazy from the isolation at their base.
The husky is put in with the Americans dogs.The American's pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell)and the teams doctor
Dr.Copper(Richard Dysart)fly to the neighbouring Norwegian science base
and what they discover there terrifies them. The base is destroyed and
they find some dead bodies including something that looks half human
and half something else. They bring it back to the base and try and
find out what it is. They conclude it's alien (a suspicion that's
confirmed when they look at some tapes they found at the Norwegian
base), these show that team digging a spaceship out from under the ice
and recovering an alien from the craft.The husky that was being chased is the alien and has taken on the
appearance of the husky. When it's in the kennels it transforms and
tries to assimilate the other dogs into itself. That's prevented by the
team when they hear the disturbance and then everyone comes to realise
they are being threatened by an alien. The film really becomes scary
when they realise that this thing could have assimilated one or more of
them and someone in the team may not be human after all. The team no
longer knows if they can trust one another or not and have to try and
uncover the alien among them.The entire cast are superb especially Russell as the heroic Macready.
Wilford Brimley is also memorable as the scientist who realises that
the team can't in all good conscience leave the base because they could
take the thing back to civilisation and it could infect the population.Ennio Morricone's chilling score that sounds like a heartbeat really
adds to the horror atmosphere and the special effects help make the
story realistic. As with Alien (1979)not using computer effects but
physical things that the actors can interact with and that look real
gives the film a realistic look. You get scared because what you're
seeing looks so real.The films ambiguous ending and realistic effects have no doubt helped
the film achieve the fame it has today and both are quite the talking
point. The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made and is a
must see.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low
expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for
which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog?
What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American
base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more
important question: which of these men have been infected by the
titular "thing?"Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and
question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying
to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside
of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied
motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly
stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not
unlike "And Then There Were None." One thing bothered me in this film:
remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of
writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity
could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and
this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just
found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while
the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a
double until they ultimately perish.

When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond
terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a
shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30
years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore,
but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful
classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more
influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie – no frigging
contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s
and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas
were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies
like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young
directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the
medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free
to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the
film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is
almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads,
other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The
cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors
were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are
no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset
to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the
introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's
visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen
time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical
effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that
has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a
wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and
because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent
2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part
because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech
cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a
helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one
of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately.
There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing,
you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds
almost like a Lovecraftian version of "Ten Little Indians". Once The
Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with
tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation
of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the
scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only
ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent,
the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best
jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to
about a half dozen people, and the "test" scene has made somebody jump
out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of
characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound,
and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost
immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that
there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy
who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the
doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big
tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a
body count, every death feels significant, because even minor
characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies
ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has
such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release,
and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy
it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the
true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as
"horror"), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.

John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film
ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special
effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror
film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time
favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in
Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover
that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and
killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you
trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a
bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven
Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take
on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by
critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now
considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and
the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many
reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of
the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects
is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop
trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and
Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will
come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The
film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and
atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the
alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film
it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known
around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though
The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and
distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill
Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters
great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who
they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't
paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the
dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel
isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where
to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the
chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both
films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set
in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel
by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of
the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the
original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien
was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film
looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and
different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and
terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse
trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness
and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have
nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they
all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing
is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline
themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many
years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until
the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal
truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens
you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The
Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the
ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy
answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all
time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly
brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is
excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things
fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes
crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald
Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role.
T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard
Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles
Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter
Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is
always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and
doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by
Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the
dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most
ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history.
Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard
for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic
that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in
every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's
greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows
how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi
chiller "The Thing from Another World" about an alien that tangles with
a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out.
Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster
went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella "Who Goes
There?" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the
colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not
for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter
that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes.
"The Thing" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and
probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising,
and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while
he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense,
humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens
with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept
terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before
they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy
Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before
long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and
tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and
wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of
suspenseful situations.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This is the classic John Carpenter re-visitation/tribute to the
original 'The Thing From Another World' which was adapted from John W.
Campbell's book, 'Who Goes There?', and it begins like a slick and
subtle action in the Antarctic movie just before it gradually develops
into a spectacle of mind-blowing special effects and paranoid tension.Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley are among the occupants
of a remote research station in the Antarctic when they discover the
remains of an alien creature frozen in the ice that is able to
assimilate any living organism by reproducing its cell-structure. This
premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an
overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The
Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the
most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this
day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever
made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a
feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script
focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most
memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the
alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs
in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget
to mention the infamous "spider head" scene which for many is the
film's most gruesome highlight. This is one of the great films that
forged itself timelessly from the world of nightmares and unknown
horrors, and will remain as a major contribution to monster effects
history.

This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as
near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast,
the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror
film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This
movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say
there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of
dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from
the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable
horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The
imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to
a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work
here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in
to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's
release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their
heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was
awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast
members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this
movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this
monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror
(particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the
earliest opportunity.

It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the
big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's
cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly
Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a
helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky
with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the
passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing
the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research
team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot
down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered
crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to
be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel
who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian
base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned
base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had
been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like
something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to
the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes
the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of
the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the
creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team.
When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and
looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and
hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of
the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members?
Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even
feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the
darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect
another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person
is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by
Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance
in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization,
it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him
over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of
mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's
original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite
an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a
shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that
required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John
Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the
original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?'
by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting
creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact
the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or
personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers
in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in
'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous
for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his
movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced,
well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don
Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956,
where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his
claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to
be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature
the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of
showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and
gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special
effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's
version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia
and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure
to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in
the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the
phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its
extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an "R" rating by the
Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a
cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest
horror films ever made.

Once you finish reading this I want you to do the following: Turn your
computer off. Save all the files that need to be saved. Put your shoes
on, grab your wallet and your keys. Get out of your house and find the
closest rental store or DVD store. Simply go in Buy or rent John
Carpenter's The Thing and walk out. There's really no need of getting a
second movie. Get back home, disconnect your phone, turn off your
cellphone and turn all your lights off. Make sure you are alone, no
girl/boyfriend, no best friend, no parents. Watch it. This may seem
like a ridiculous review right now but trust me, once the credits pop
up, you will be thanking me I wrote these instructions for you. Enjoy
the night10/10

I think this is one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. The setting
is brilliant, the isolation is total and the paranoia feels believable.
The creature itself without giving too much away has a very simple and
understandable desire to survive. You can imagine if it had ended up
somewhere less remote and although you get little information about its
origins it doesn't matter because like the aliens in the movie Aliens
you know enough about it to know it's damn scary.The effects have held up fairly well, there are bits that still make me
jump but the point is that it's a very well told story and the
characters are likable and though thinly sketched also feel like real
people. I loved this movie and I have watched it many times since it
came out, if you haven't seen it then treat yourself to a night of
quality entertainment.I'd rate this gem as highly as Aliens, it's simply brilliant and the
dogs acting easily beats most of Hollywoods current 'talent' hands or
paws down.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and
difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica.
Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a
station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even
more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with
anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and
lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of
paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the
unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual
situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying
to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting
everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there.
And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the
Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was
defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great
information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to
imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying
to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film
begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has
a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter
pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think
about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to
survive just like them. The last part is just great with the "still
humans" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope
that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they
can do is to wait there for a little while…see what happens."The Thing" was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was
released just after "E.T." back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure
but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of
course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is
also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape
from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest
of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the
entire cast.Conclusion: "The Thing" is just another great film of John Carpenter
that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases.
In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the
classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels & sequels, mixes between two
films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter
film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the
thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake
where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad
taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in
this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc
collector's edition of "The Thing". It contains many bonus materials:
the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary "John
Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" (the only problem with this
documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic
director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with
the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast,
Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location
Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and
full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters),
Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer. THAT'S A
DVD!

- A helicopter chases a husky across the frozen landscape of
Antarctica. The two Norwegians chasing the dog seem intent on killing
it. The dog makes a bee-line for the American science station in what
appears to be an attempt to seek safety. But is that really the dog's
purpose? The Americans discover the dog's true mission only after it's
too late.- I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I hadn't seen The Thing since
its initial theatrical run. Because so much of the movie had slowly
slipped from my memory, I have never placed it on a "favorites" list
(until now). In fact, I had forgotten more of the movie than I
remembered. I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my
third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of
the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never
lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.- If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special
effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and
an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob
Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on
The Thing.- But it takes more than effects and gore to make a "good" movie. It's
the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of
mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved.
These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with
little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere.
But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various
members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save
their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.- As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many
movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question
raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it
does answers. Good call, Carpenter! - I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much
on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try
as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really
appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these
men are. The characters can be described as paper thin. The 1951 movie
was more character driven, and as a result, I cared more for the
characters.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard
Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and
camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a
variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances
that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military
in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John
Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not
exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by
John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body
Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature "infects" others and takes on
their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept,
but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in
crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the
viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some
Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a
group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the
Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American
facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of
the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who
has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out.
Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his
thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no
discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a
capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even
lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne
imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled
testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a
distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into
cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already
relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their
assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot,
character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention
is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show
extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into
the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its
guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the
kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The
dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody
rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of
quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal
writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure,
when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the
1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this
sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another
chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro,
chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their
own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would
have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this
initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this
depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose
thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he
makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There
is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all
unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who
The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than
because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter
tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to
have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation
and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem
to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf
Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together
and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even
the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst
the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one
is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing
that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world
would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then
again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would
be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics
talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing
could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film
was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical
reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to
consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting
should trump storytelling.

American researchers at an Antarctic outpost find themselves faced with
a shape-shifting alien that can assume the form of any person or animal
it absorbs. The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is
just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would
say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally.
It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the
bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more
closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which
was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.The Thing boasts one of the strongest casts of any movie made in the
last forty years. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Kurt Russell's
MacReady is one of his best roles. Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart,
Keith David, Richard Masur, and on down the line are great actors.
Everybody gives their all. John Carpenter's direction is excellent.
It's been said by many that it's his best work. It's really hard to
argue with that. Surprisingly, he doesn't do the score for this one.
Instead the great Ennio Morricone scores it but does so in a manner
very similar to what Carpenter himself might have done. Rob Bottin's
special effects are terrifically fun in the way only old school effects
could be. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a
classic. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. If you
haven't, what are you waiting for?

The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious,
thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in
the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the
appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect
and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the
tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy
chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All
actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is
loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open
ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why
there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they
could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror
classic.

It's a pleasure to review this movie as I have seen it so many times.
Even more so, since recently I showed it to my 21 year old friend for
the first time. Had you been there for the amount of "NOOOO", (Gasps),
"WHAT" & "OH MY GOD" reactions, all of which left me in tears. It
proves that John Carpenter's gross out remake of this 1950's Sci-Fi
classic, continues to work its magic even today.Based on the short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell. A group
of researchers in Antarctica, stumble across an alien life form at an
abandoned post. You never fully see it, and it can assimilate its host
whilst picking them off one by one. From there on tension rises, and
trusts are tested. Leading to some of the most jaw dropping, gruesome
creature effects ever committed to cinema.Watching this recently in the Blu-ray format, just shows how timeless
this movie really is. Kurt Russell brings us an incredibly likable
anti-hero, whose most prominent scene stealing moment is the legendary
"Blood Test" scene. All this with Rob Bottin's spectacular creature
effects, and Ennio Morricone's tense heart beating soundtrack paints
"Antarctica" as if it was another planet (Actually frozen sound stages
in Los Angeles, and British Columbia).Final Verdict: "Halloween" (1978) is a classic, but "The Thing" is John
Carpenter's masterpiece. It continues to remain superior, regardless of
any recent sequel-prequel homages. 9/10. Brilliant Sci-fi Horror.

Over the last several years remakes have been a big money maker. This
is especially true of the Horror genre. Most genre buffs would say this
trend must go, but the studios keep churning them out. It's not that
remakes of classic films is a new thing, but until now few found much
success. One of famed director John Carpenter's biggest influences is
the late director Howard Hawks. You can find many homages and
references to Hawk's work in many of Carpenter's films.Now apparently Hawks wasn't as involved with the original 'The Thing'
as originally thought, but still his presence must show in it
somewhere. Carpenter had success with nearly every film before this one
and after Sci-Fi/Horror hits like 'Alien' you'd think people would have
flocked to Carpenter's version of 'The Thing.' Instead the film
performed poorly at the Box Office and wasn't exactly a hit with
critics either. But over the years, like some of the director's other
works, the film has gained a strong following. This was the first time
I've seen the film in it's entirety and personally I just can't see
what could have kept it from reaching success.Pros: Good work from the ensemble cast. Breathtaking cinematography and
scenery. Startling and impressive effects. Perfect and claustrophobic
setting. Some really creepy moments and images that you won't be able
to shake. After a slow start, the paces moves along. An excellent and
at times chilling score that was undeserved of it's Razzie nomination.
As usual Carpenter does a great job of creating suspense and tension.Cons: Characters could have used some more developing. Anticlimactic
ending.Final thoughts: Though perhaps not Carpenter's greatest achievement,
this film is none the less a solid piece of scary entertainment. Few
films of this kind today have the effect this one does. It's held up
very well and is the kind of film you may not want to watch at night
alone. A real skin crawler from one of the masters.My rating: 4/5

On my mission to watch the IMDb top 250 I have only recently delved
into the horror genre and I have been surprised in how much I have
enjoyed them. I had watched Psycho (9/10) a while ago but in succession
I have watched "The Shining" (10/10), "The Thing" (9/10) and "Alien"
(7/10) in that order. One of the criticisms which annoys me greatly
about "The Thing" is that is lends itself far too much on the success
of "Alien". I don't think it lends itself to "Alien" at all and I hope
to explain why this very similar film is superior. The characters and performances are spectacular from everyone involved
and are the most three dimensional I have seen in such a large cast. In
most horror films (including "Alien") not all of the characters need to
be unique and relatable- especially the weaker, more expendable
characters. In "The Thing" EVERY character is important, not just to
increase the viewer's investment in the characters and their horrifying
situation but the whole plot and concept of the film is dependent on
it. The thing imitates other lifeforms so characters need to be fleshed
out to make the thing as scary as it is in its ability to perfectly
confuse the humans as to what it is. The paranoia, the sense of
isolation, the sense of claustrophobia and the sense of innate fear is
palpable at all times in the film by watching the genuinely enthralling
events occur. There is great variety in terms of characters- even
before the thing appears- which is incredibly interesting to see it
develop. We see MacReady assume leadership and the doubts over it, we
see Gary's leadership deteriorate, we see Blair's madness, we see Clark
deal with constant accusations, we see Child's aggression and
stubbornness. This is to acknowledge just a few of the more pertinent
characters who have layers of depth as the film progresses. The
unmentioned characters would be particularly notable if they were in
any other horror film but they are even dwarfed by the main cast in
"The Thing" showing how great it is. To say that "The Thing" copied
"Alien" by having an alien attack an isolated large crew of relatable
characters is wildly false- especially when this is a remake of the
1951 and adopted from a short story. Even if it is inspired by "Alien"
it is superior to the film in terms of characters which is largely due
to their unique situation of an alien that imitates your closest
friends thus adding far more nuance to each individual. The film is far more tense that any film I have seen- including
"Alien". There is a constant sense of threat because the people who you
are friends with and depend on for survival in numbers include things
which are trying to kill you. I don't know what's scarier; being in a
group of people knowing that at least one is a thing waiting to kill
you or being alone knowing that there is a thing out there who is
trying to kill you but nobody is there to help. Its utter genius in my
opinion and, again, far more nuanced than "Alien" where there is
essentially just a predator in a spaceship who is trying to kill all of
the crew- you feel safer in the group but not on your own which already
cuts the fear factor in half. Then there is the fact that in "Alien"
there is surprisingly little conflict between the humans and alien
unless the people are alone and/or looking to come into contact with
the alien. In fact there is little physical opposition to the "Alien"-
nobody attacks the alien to test its strength unlike in "The Thing"
where flamethrowers are used throughout. In "The Thing" there is a
constant evolving and escalating situation; the humans defeat a thing
and get the upper hand until another thing assimilates another human
and shifts the balance. In alien its a predictable one-way street and
the outcome is visible a mile away. In "The Thing" we see an incredibly
good ending which is highly ambiguous and adds richly to the complexity
of the film. The Thing in short is infinitely more complex and cerebral
then "Alien". I haven't even mentioned Ennio Morricone's fantastic
pulsating claustrophobic score which helps to heightens the tension.
That being said the periods of silence in the film are also extremely
welcome and effective. The use of practical effects in this film are simply phenomenal and,
whilst alien has some good effects whenever the alien is present on the
rare occasion, is far better than "Alien" or any contemporary. its a
shame that we don't have practical effects like this anymore and rely
too heavily on CGI- it so much less realistic. The direction is great
from horror legend John Carpenter and, although this is my first film
of his, I can't imagine that he has made a better film. In short this
film is fantastic and needs to be seen, I am tempted to go back and
give it a 10/10 but I'll save that decision until I venture onto my
first reviewing.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I
actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it
Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy.
This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story "Who Goes There?",
which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which
saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter
is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting
alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has
nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting
and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in
the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable
body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off
bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel
transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a
boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that
one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of
the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a
plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not
to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which
Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent
blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests
their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great
and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so
believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst,
crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to
care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario
imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super
movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for
yourself.

When you're making a horror movie, one of the most important things you
should do, is a working atmosphere. This movie does it perfectly. It
doesn't get "straight to business". It builds the horror slowly. Second
thing: Use computer graphics as little as possible. The Thing uses
puppets which are, in my opinion, still way more realistic and
frightening than CGI. And probably always will.I rarely give any movie a perfect score. This masterpiece gets 10/10
hands down. In my book, still unbeatable decades after it's release. I
really can't say anything else about this movie. If you haven't seen
this classic, and you're tired modern "horror" movies, try something
different for a change. Close your room's curtains to make it
completely dark, put headphones on your ears, and watch this movie.

Childs: "I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit."Palmer:"Childs, happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the
skies like flies. Government knows all about it, right, Mac?" John Carpenter's The Thing really is something else and I can't even
imagine how impressed I would've been if I was there to watch it when
it came out. There's a reason why The Thing is praised by many critics
and considered to be one of the best Horror movies ever. It's visually
repulsive, in a good way, thanks to the isolated setting in Antarctica,
fantastic make-up and practical effects. In fact, this may be my
favourite Horror movie ever based on practical effects. Personally, I
prefer practical effects over CGI. A good combination of both works as
well. The Thing remains complete as both a Horror and Sci-Fi movie.Besides being eye candy, the paranoia caused between the researchers is
something well executed. It's by no means deeply layered or complex. In
fact, it's rather straightforward but just like the researchers you try
to focus and pay attention to all the little details as you're trying
to figure things out for yourself. Each scene made me wonder: "What
would I do in this situation", which is something I happen to like.
It's safe to say that there were no holds barred when it came to
imagination. To top it all off, you have Kurt Russell, which takes a
sip of his bottle of J&B every couple of minutes, and some cheesy but
acceptable dialogue. The Thing will forever remain an iconic piece of
work, no matter how much the movie industry transforms.

Some of the best horror starts with an isolated environment. A Cabin in
the woods (Evil Dead), a boat harassed by a giant shark with no land in
sight (Jaws) and so on. This time it's a research team trapped by a
blizzard in Antarctica with no hope of rescue.Kurt Russell is brilliant in this. This movie is decades old, but hasn't aged one day. The visual fx in it
are nothing short of astounding and Carpenter's atmospheric music adds
a eerie creepiness to this film in just the right amount and in the
right places. Genius composer Ennio Morricone is credited as composer,
but the opening tones is all Carpenter.Of all his film, this is apparently John Carpenter's favorite. Watch
this movie and you'll see why. It's my favorite of his too.

The Thing is one of the best horror movies, but it was a box office
flop as the gore and bleak tone was too much for audiences at the time.
The basic premise: an alien virus called The Thing infects people,
assimilates their body and controls their mind. The Thing emulates the
human in an uncanny way. It's up to the viewer to guess which of the
people are innocent and which of the people have been turned into
aliens.The first half-hour is slow by modern standards but it builds the
setting well. The make-up artistry is superbly done to create
terrifying moments. The tension between the characters and their
mistrust of each other in this situation makes for some intense moments
as the situation continually gets worse.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This movie is very suspenseful. A nail biter. It reminded me of the
Alien movies: an isolated group of people with little to no outside
communications, and little to no way of escaping. All they can do is
track the thing(ha). There was a keen sense of very rightful paranoia.
As you see, this thing, is a chameleon, and could be anyone or more
than one.There's lots of gory grossness, and may even be scary to some people. I
mainly found it suspenseful. What's missing, is well, a Ripley. Or any
female for that matter. The entire cast is male. Mmmn, I could overlook
that, but kept feeling a lack of something, and I think that was it.It has a great little track of a suspenseful sound effect, almost like
a heartbeat slowed down and with the pitched changed. All the acting
was very good. The ending was a little disappointing. I don't know if
they were setting up for a sequel, or the director wanted to leave it
mysterious. I would have preferred a more defined ending.I just watched it for the first time, and for 1982, it has held up very
well. If you like the Alien movies I think you will definitely like
this movie.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Carpenter is an outstanding horror-suspense director, but he simply
outdid himself with "The Thing," crafting a horror film rarely touched
by any other in intelligence or quality of the ensemble cast. The film
truly captures the horror of Campbell's short story, light years ahead
of the 50s version, while maintaining the same fearsome idea: that
there could be things out there that will take us over, absorb us, and
we would not even really know. It's a hysteria that drove many 50s
science fiction flicks, but by the 1980s it could be reduced to its
pure essence, without that heavy-handed "US vs. the Soviets" thing.When I saw this in the theater in 1982, I felt queasy several times
during the film. Yes, as in "about to throw up." It was the uncanny
realism of the special effects. It has been remarked that The Thing,
and the special effects that embody it, are truly a living character in
this film, and it is true. Rob Bottin, Stan Winston, Bill Sturgeon, and
the makeup/creature crew did things that could never be done as
realistically with CGI effect. And director Carpenter uncompromisingly
selected only the best of it for the final cut, as anyone who has seen
the "deleted scenes" can attest. Gone are any stop-motion animation or
slightly imperfect scenes. The artistic triumvirate and its
perfectionist director created the ultimate thing.The ensemble cast of characters, trapped in an Antarctic science
station where a creature that absorbs all life forms in their own image
gets them one by one, is amazingly good. Yes, Kurt Russell gets first
billing and survives to the last, but every character, down to the
Norwegian rifleman who tries to warn the Americans of their impending
doom when a seemingly harmless husky trots their way, is perfectly cast
and plays his perfect role in the grand scheme of things.The film scares, amuses, excites, spellbinds, disgusts, simply
everything you could ask of a horror film. Every time I see it, I like
it better despite knowing how every character will end, and how the web
of dread, hopelessness and helplessness is cast to the bitter end by
The Thing.

The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the
characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien
veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into
contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J.
MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a
group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily
plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize
that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one
of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create
a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film
you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings,
you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never
for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap.
Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of
it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away
here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an
understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a
group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the
creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional
meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects
in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome.
They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing'
itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien
you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance
for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the
creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images,
and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and
today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper
recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then
ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in
effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi
and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in
anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at
the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere,
the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that
makes this movie great.

Truly one of the greatest examples of American horror cinema ever
committed to celluloid. Legendary director John Carpenter uses every
part of his immense talent to produce a true classic that just seems to
get better with age. The camera glides from scene to scene & creates a
magnificent atmosphere filled with paranoia & dread. The make up
effects are a true delight created by Rob Bottin who produces some of
the best effects you are ever likely see on film. On initial release
The Thing was a box office failure mainly due to E.T being released at
the same time which took over everything in its path. However the movie
has picked up a massive cult following over the years & is rightly
regarded as a true horror classic today. A brilliant piece of cinema
from a true master director....They don't make movies like this
anymore,sublime.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Very few horror films remain locked under cult favourite status while
at the same time being hailed by critics and widespread audiences as
possibly the greatest horror film of all time.While it has been pointed out by movie legends such as George Romero
and Stephen King that people love being scared by a good horror movie,
it is not specifically the case with majority audiences. Films such as
The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as
the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the
mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less
physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse
science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box
office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood,
Steven Spielberg, had released E.T: The Extra Terrestrial at the same
time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and
petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it
with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to
bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every
moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world
strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared
and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the
end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds
itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant
Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in
regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions
leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with
no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the
Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death
and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse
is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly
the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear,
fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining
life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within
their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it
is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that
it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one,
fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady -
played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt
Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart
under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from
those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that
nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by
effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the
way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the
world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men.
There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting
in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where
safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is
multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog
pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are
losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never
sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark,
depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic
special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors
ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature
ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G.
Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that
wants to make yet another slasher/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an
intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a
minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I
dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an
education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival
John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!

Horror, like hot sauce, is a kind of self-indulgence. It's considered
part of the sport to try to push the envelope, be it a seared mouth or
a heart attack. I think John Carpenter has designed a movie for the
audience who says, "C'mon scare us to death."Every element of this movie is exquisitely crafted -- from the
soundtrack to the cutting and pacing to the uncompromising, unrelenting
savagery -- all packaged in sharp, handsome photography and skilled
acting. The buildup is a crescendo of violence and gore.But what's the point of all these fine production values? A message?
Existential dread? Survival? Compare this one to Alien. Both climax
with the hero calling out the great terror. Like cowboys. You know, the
outlaws move into town and kill everybody until they meet the lone hero
in the final showdown. Here, the story is just a vehicle for the real
purpose of this film: pure horror.Almost 30 years later, and John Carpenter's The Thing is still the
scariest movie I've ever seen. If I lived for being scared to death,
then I'd give it a 10.
