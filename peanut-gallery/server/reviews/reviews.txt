As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.

What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.

This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.

If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.

If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the
idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony
with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take
over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes
completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly
abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly
exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the
shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for
gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The
storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is
never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but
other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are
pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other
function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and
no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this
film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.

It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this
should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the
Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another
research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team
they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic
any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has
infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are.
This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you
can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat
out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital
presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually
when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare
on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly
to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it
on the big screen for anyone.

(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing?
An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's
pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque
alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new,
little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets
decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves
around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one
they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left
ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before
being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're
killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the
flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was
the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is.
However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get
mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken
vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it
has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have
disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy
dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me
happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it
already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.

The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's
Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior
to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing
From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and
answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original.
The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier.
Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting
at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting
you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this
movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb
performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the
madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in
this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing
performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust
for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest
horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the
perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's
body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the
person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and
acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the
movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along
you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and
coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the
perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob
Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making
sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and
made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the
movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the
movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and
The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the
original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans,
see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see
the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you
will see the genius of this movie.10/10

'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a
quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or
'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York,
Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell
Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing'
came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the
public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too
gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a
cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best
John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that
are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the
identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and
if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is
based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and
adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly
represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's
movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he
adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here
is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien
and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly.
There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which
proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many
fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create
some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is
headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the
leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He
does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course
this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to
work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from
Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of
Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was
certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a
very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie.
He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and
it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every
Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way
Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening
sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best
opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood
perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie.
The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the
animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup
to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today
a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio
Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use
of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The
cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The
reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to
what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally
realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status.
The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's
perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror
movies ever made. 10/10

People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but
The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the
extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is
only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as
a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing,
superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best
endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless
viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and
analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film
justice. Absolutely essential viewing.

The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a
timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best
movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a
lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect
setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched
The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our
sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even
today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin
and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make
the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic
anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you
can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the
perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If
you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than
this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and
horror.

The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell,
as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter
because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it
touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John
W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing
is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with
fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models,
that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw
them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed
and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell
as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious
leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible.
Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates
the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character
for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage,
giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful
looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The
direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for
example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who
isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows
just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this
winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to
the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter
did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt
like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives
the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the
tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the
actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and
John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did
not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue
scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much
as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust
to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along
with Alien. 10/10 from me.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an
Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to
live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through
the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this
dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can
change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases.
AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my
cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible
Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie
including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with
his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's
motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role
really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It
has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects
and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back
of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica.
A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met
with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life
form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely
appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self
destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the
alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not
human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien
is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to
be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long
enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated
in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has
to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is
contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in
their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black
and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one
dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one,
but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold,
in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to
be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more
advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be
enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1

* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing – today a highly treasured cult
favourite – one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and
critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that
phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide)
had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office
rampage.
Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate
of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was
prepared – moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine
remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained
such
a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and
critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks'
version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story
"Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out
how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell
will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire
cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and
armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It
feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film
history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in
classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar
ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper,
compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today – 18 years after – looks
downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his
ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film,
making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic
and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a
palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a
record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque
special effects. Be warned – there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The
Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find
them
disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has
its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a
crowd
of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research
facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece,
his
own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a
rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every
way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it
never
barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of -
DVD
version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at
a
human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a
wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not
the
point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror
movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection,
making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack
me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to
show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to,
but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no
more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films
ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is
how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a
group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission,
but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy
Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The
Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is
when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting
alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims
– in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well
that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their
friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for
their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed
amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things
are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at
all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand
years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic
ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the
Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural
prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien"
(1979). Many comparisons have been made – the protagonists are stranded in a
desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off
one-by-one. However, "The Thing" – for all practical purposes – came
first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.
(writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted
as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The
result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be
fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake
does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what
essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the
short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably
portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many
advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what
could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening
(and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually
taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the
effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years
later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit
too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its
ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all
time, "The Thing" – by any standards – is unconventional Hollywood at its
best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing"
performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." – released the same year and
featuring a much kinder alien – became the higher-grossing picture of the
two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every
conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th
Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually
climbed a ladder of cult classics – it is one of the most famous non-famous
movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career – from his amazing
"Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the
disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his
very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never
been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The
Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and – upon close inspection
– masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is
simultaneously unique and chilling – a genuine relief for film buffs who are
tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is
genuinely unpredictable.


Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on
this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI,
blue
screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was
born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The
Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan
of
John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In
'The
Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut
wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but
only
like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of
this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an
alien
lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact
with,
and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an
alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of
relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into
manic
paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a
creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a
truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you
truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel
and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one
second
do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has
perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any
genre
for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it
will
leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a
man
thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of
men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that
has
driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in
this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They
blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is
a
truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever
seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood
had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really
thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what
would
you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature
waiting
to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this
movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this
review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition
it
deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies
are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be
appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic
widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible
scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat
inducing,
gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even
with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will
afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye


I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this
film
was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and
bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or
action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look
into
the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear,
lent
not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the
incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is
spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct
result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all
american
hero".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and
the
net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic
film.

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to
watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age
of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie
obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there
were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to
pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left
off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some
miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of
some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I
could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana
peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the
humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and
reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over
by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its
paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one;
the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot
be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath
is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and
Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and
the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main
character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre.
Don't miss it.


John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. 
Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. 
What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. 
Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions
where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to
Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not
only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a
paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is
worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in
films.


Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get
surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a
helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the
Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and
questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film
I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid
mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was
nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as
far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really
gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog
who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say
nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive?
Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this.
Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has
done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects
makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen
due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known.
In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked
have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over
twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long
time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to
date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it
several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a
Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady
keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!


Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite
movie.
My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing!
The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the
splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the
movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from
N.Y.)
In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to
do
with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting.
I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day
the
last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even
the
great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror
movies:
Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're
not
interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV
and
watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll
see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.


Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are
in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a
thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything
it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance
to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're
isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are
they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That
movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based
more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?")
and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with
Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone
and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding.
There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off,
heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first
by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material.
I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw
this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just
incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful.
You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score
really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any
distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced
and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with
"E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there
being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of
John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date
film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along
with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they
play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid
that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be
close to a facility to throw up!

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it
the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is
that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W
Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that
builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the
strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold.
Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery
that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film
is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with
potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together
under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie
pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming
throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter
favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters
get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending
that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm
and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and
see what happens indeed. 10/10

A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious
alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect
copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant
special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a
cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes
charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One
of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the
idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it
had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is
very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and
the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from
the genius of John Carpenter.

If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are
other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have
probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley
Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives
"Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop
of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the
best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of
horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his
creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but
this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch
performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen
writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's
impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a
would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb
scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering
somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good
either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this
movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now,
it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason:
It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which
went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult
status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night
on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that.
Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I
watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a
sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the
haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in
"Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of
isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it
is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a
century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of
what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films
shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the
production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is
replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and
isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking
place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing,
claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella
from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien
life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability
to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them
perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and
communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team,
once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to
get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way
the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of
their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just
a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I
am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the
unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down,
but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to
kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while
the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific
ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is
utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the
animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the
animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what
was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that
remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really
terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is
nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you
plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good
old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I
can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone
produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building
scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team
and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting
to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare
combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and
inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.

I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the
great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of
the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to
happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had
his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror.
He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like
this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see
through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in
this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes
me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to
keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the
actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great
directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror
classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more
power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of
the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's
almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were
much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they
couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being
afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved
thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien.
They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr.
Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors
couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then
they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great
story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this
situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an
organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this
classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and
let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches
you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not
know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes
won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from
popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular
the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is
money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until
they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't
know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about
cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll
just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to
make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.

John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people
have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean.
What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I
have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling,
bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is
really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the
acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is
perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the
atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere
and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it
could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical
score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The
main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts
you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to
happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by
everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never
really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw
this.

This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one
of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in
an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases
an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the
shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense.
It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the
Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in.
Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form
mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form – kind of – and is
burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely
infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect
mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features
some of the best special effects of its time – they have not dated a
bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The
monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that
takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different
organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside,
though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody
trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps
The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot
makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually
end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself
is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or
who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see
anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including
two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the
movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a
1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.

The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of
Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble
deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of
researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization.
The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the
chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer
of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of
who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen
threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to
trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted
by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always
try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn
into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just
thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good.
We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has
done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is
so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a
crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse,
and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits.
Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI
technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only
the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all
horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood
setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those
things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects
aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the
film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved,
but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did
the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by
blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him
company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late).
When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me
captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think
and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly
all the way to the end.

To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot
top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with
almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T.
made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually
in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star
Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a
few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating.
E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a
classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien,
Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers
with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm
sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic,
still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are
masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing
pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD
as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this
film.

This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy,
desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special
effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime
casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the
greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test
scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it
parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this
paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen.
John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his
hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a
time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing
is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.

SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently
copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME
FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a
totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome
film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.

If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream",
then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one
can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella
called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made
a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became
a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a
cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien.
Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake
THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by
it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have
known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source
material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now
the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's
running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems...
Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing
appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and
mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic
locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a
John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as
do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The
dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever
filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's
terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer,
there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So
make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO
GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!

At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research
party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their
campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is
shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they
head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown
origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to
find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human
parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the
ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon
enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing
strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn
on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it
was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror
genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I
never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed
that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion
I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around.
Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad
timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty
much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly
become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans.
The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly
dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one
of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and
definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New
York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming
before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from
another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W.
Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal
itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural
form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking
resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare
the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for
me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love
the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene
alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about
Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly
revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in
creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are
incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The
gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved.
Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the
paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a
well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and
Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines,
where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I
thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the
overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even
the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy
to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere
that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath
it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's
nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the
chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's
simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers
the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to
what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write
home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his
charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in
this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional,
but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism
factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable.
Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off
alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the
red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can
be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less
stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from
another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on
the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and
sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up
proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the
assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but
authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another
thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty
wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just
makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix
gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational
viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves
you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's
crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the
innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many
years to come.


"The Thing" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's
filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special
effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is
also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter
cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly
humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and
see it now!A must-see!
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the
actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all
setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very
little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much
to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends
for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never
hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry
says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only
one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings
body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the
movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster...
who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying?
After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they
never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling
Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is
always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at
risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only
one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out
flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have
figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they
do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base
with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but
then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the
whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who
thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a
scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the
movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing
they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any),
then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of
the best special effects of its time.

The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the
lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak,
unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing,
based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the
finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien,
another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where
no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown
alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the
sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of
nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other
shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the
pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to
crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable
atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated
by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too
uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best
endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is
told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the
characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien.
There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough
screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good,
like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to
see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually
wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're
not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances
should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good
at what it does.

A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by
men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and
die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this
outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene…John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing
From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the
original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent
use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still
look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that
has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the
sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story.
Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people
that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the
fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio
Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a
frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that
followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to
the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is
the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and
claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.

Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to
different from the original and they make it more violent well this
movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this
movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its
john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it
in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but
it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the
body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the
frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a
worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and
i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets
leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.

When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I
can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing
being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a
little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special
effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching
it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the
top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this
time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how
bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping
mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I
found it repulsive – I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a
fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs
get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but
my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters – I love David
Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach
turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging
watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So
perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But
they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an
imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself
along – and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its
body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's
the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts
and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man
who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of
shots it's obviously a dummy…which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head
being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its
mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts
antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap.
And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either – the bit
where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and
the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the
end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing
alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and
Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then
after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's
sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable
film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates
in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't
realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing
is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene
where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers
to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's
not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been
assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he
says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally
could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain
he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do
we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too
(they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is
when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp
(he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off
an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching
in the film…which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady
visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit
and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then
begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb
scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the
dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady
thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is
that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation,
and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's
become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an
ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero
and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a
Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.

So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me,
absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T.
is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds
up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell
playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man
should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it
(so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind,
now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up
from me).And that was the review…But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will
continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter
fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first
screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest
screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up
in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole
together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense
atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of
the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I
wasn't going to be disappointed… If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow)
that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to
watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for
this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media
you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph
that this film's first scene brings to its audience…In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!

What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After
establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their
colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable
line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept
me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's
MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to
determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His
methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we
soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill
you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to
accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering
the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well,
and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story.
Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still
effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new
generation of moviegoers.

The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and
stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica
and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met
with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however
over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary
status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While
The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the
horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly
dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our
characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of
them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself.
You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character
to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in
The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the
film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be
tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out
film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another
strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of
blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and
wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the
statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all
time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking
horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a
gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some
rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling
incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10

Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films
 were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen
 this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it
 lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to
 make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt
 either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I
've seen.

The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all
the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the
inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your
time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee
out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest,
ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any
other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really
gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood
and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread,
isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling,
freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several
Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day,
they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from
gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is
battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants.
It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished,
but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't
tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald
Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few
of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great
genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of
the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.

The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was
ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that
impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen
anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the
movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the
claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction
and tension between the members of the doomed research station that
makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the
the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored
scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see
them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the
Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain
of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score
that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this
point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha
Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as
the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien.
Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by
one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The
mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses
until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making
production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same
weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all
round with some great performances by the cast.
*** This review may contain spoilers ***
In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were
both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The
Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people
the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people
were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable,
they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an
optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating
heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life
as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET
was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated
saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a
substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare
example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the
1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways.
Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a
film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien.
And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The
Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica
as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to
establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on
characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the
actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds
them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the
success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's
perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an
Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's
guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby
station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from
the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve
the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to
their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a
shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice,
and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of
absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right
down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way
through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who
is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted
to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like
Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of
Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could
truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like
Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool
sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has
he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the
ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its
presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly.
And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An
approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in
Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of
The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing
transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous
shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws,
spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are
so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too
realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges
the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects
setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he
seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often
bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications.
Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits,
but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know
anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much
more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is
who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains
its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio
Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie,
spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a
wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they
blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such
dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without
even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you
with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated
film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than
ET!

This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to
be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from
almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed
respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that
have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of
movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both
Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the
staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did
well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit
unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich
in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as
intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the
region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo
Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is
on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the
portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply
known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small
satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned
in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never
taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty
cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's
been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as
one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most
recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said
almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many
recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with
a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I
first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your
library, you'll watch it many times . .

In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking
another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the
coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what
must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe
very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched,
brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston
also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh,
detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film
takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle
of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the
shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of
tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard
Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing
the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old
film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely
follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become
overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors
pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are
mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of
Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in
fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of
Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the
sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts
off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented
transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone.
I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky,
curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in
itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for
for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare
breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way
of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes.
That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in
fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back
to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the
creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was
done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and
atmospheric to a T.

A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most
entertaining horror films ever made – fast, clever and purely exciting
from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be
made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost
to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World)
left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base
some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains
of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might
offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back
to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is
alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing
anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them,
making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns
into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The
Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and
security found when human beings band together in spite of their
differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules
supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New
York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much
better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece
classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about
this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A
lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and
the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and
showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring
across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since
its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up
against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other
ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I
could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to
be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend?
Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If
you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other
movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first
movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they
were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the
guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not
only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining
example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out
special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense,
claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very
well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting
the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and
inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on
every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may
be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation
of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter
(Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding
performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of
the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research
team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried
in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing
alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American
science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill
Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love
this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from
master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and
one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's
characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's
best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score
from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures

The film opens ominously with a flying saucer hurtling towards the
earth's atmosphere then we are met with terrific titles which literally
'burn on to the screen 'John Carpenter's 'The Thing' The movie Begins In Antarctica Winter 1982 The first(god damn week of
winter) with Two Norwegians in a helicopter who are in hot pursuit of a
a Husky, which flees the helicopter and makes it through the snow to a
United States science station Outpost 31, The twelve all male occupants
emerge to see what's happening. as the helicopter lands the two men end
up dead one accidentally with the help of a misplaced grenade and the
other is shot dead.The Americans don't know it yet, but their camp has just been
infiltrated by a shape-shifting alien, And as the tag-line so
succinctly puts it "Man is the warmest place to hide." this just has to
be John Carpenter's finest picture it has now received the recognition
it finally deserves, i always watch this classic on a regular basis
it's a film upon every viewing you can get different readings to an
extent it is quotable there is a prequel in the works but only time
will tell if it is going to be on par with this masterpiece be sure you
watch this classic in widescreen.

1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The
Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie
is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The
Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on
TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the
best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day.
Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a
fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great,
with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst
an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting
ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one"
attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans
at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise
(approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's
surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have
been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not
great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and
subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans
and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a
small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry.
Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my
curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted
Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers.

OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie
fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it
scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The
Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really
had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the
internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release!
In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton
of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror
movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be
re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest.
The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking,
realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working
in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted.
They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The
end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is
somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer.
By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a
space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the
team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and
quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this
creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire
civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this
fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John
Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!
